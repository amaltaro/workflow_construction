# Workflow Grouping Composition

A Python module for intelligently grouping workflow tasks based on their resource requirements and dependencies. This tool analyzes task characteristics and dependencies to optimize workflow execution by grouping compatible tasks together.

Research for: Optimizing Heterogeneous Workflow Construction for Enhanced Event Throughput and Efficient Resource Utilization in CMS


## Overview

The Workflow Task Grouper analyzes workflow tasks and their relationships to create optimal task groups while respecting both hard constraints (OS compatibility, architecture requirements) and soft constraints (resource utilization, performance characteristics). The system also generates all possible workflow constructions and provides comprehensive analysis and visualization capabilities.

- Implements storage rules for data volume calculation
- Calculates optimal events per job based on target wallclock time
- Provides comprehensive analysis of CPU, memory, I/O, and dependency patterns
- Supports visualization of grouping strategies and their impacts

### Core Components

1. **Task and Resource Models**:
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class TaskResources:

       time_per_event: float
       size_per_event: float
       input_events: int
       keep_output: bool  # Whether the task's output needs to be kept in shared storage

   @dataclass
   class Task:
       id: str
       resources: TaskResources
       input_task: Optional[str] = None
       output_tasks: Set[str] = None

## ðŸ“Š Metrics Documentation

The workflow construction analysis system calculates comprehensive metrics for both individual task groups and complete workflow constructions. These metrics provide insights into performance, resource utilization, and data flow characteristics.

### Workflow Construction Metrics

**Core Metrics:**
- **Event Throughput**: Events processed per second through the entire workflow
- **Total Events**: Total events processed across all groups
- **CPU Time**: Total CPU time required across all groups
- **Data Volumes**: Input, output, and stored data totals

**Key Insights:**
- Output data per event is constant across all constructions
- Throughput generally decreases with more groups due to overhead
  - However, more groups are meant to improve CPU utilization and Memory occupancy
- Stored data per event varies based on grouping strategy and exit points

ðŸ“– **[Detailed Workflow Construction Metrics Documentation](docs/workflow_construction_metrics.md)**

### Group Metrics

**Core Metrics:**
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU and memory efficiency ratios
- **Event Throughput**: Events processed per second per group
- **I/O Analysis**: Data volumes and storage requirements
- **Dependency Analysis**: Task relationships and execution paths

ðŸ“– **[Detailed Group Metrics Documentation](docs/group_metrics.md)**

### Usage in Analysis

These metrics enable:
- **Performance Comparison**: Compare throughput across different grouping strategies
- **Resource Planning**: Estimate CPU time and data storage requirements
- **Cost Analysis**: Calculate resource costs based on CPU time and storage
- **Optimization**: Identify optimal grouping strategies for specific requirements

### Example Data

All examples in the documentation are based on real data from `output/fork/5tasks/construction_metrics.json`, providing concrete values for understanding the metrics in practice.

### Usage

```python
from vis_all_groups import visualize_groups

# After getting groups from create_workflow_from_json
visualize_groups(groups, construction_metrics, template_path, output_dir="output", dag=dag)
```

Or run directly from command line:
```bash
# Basic usage with default output directory
python src/vis_all_groups.py tests/sequential/3tasks.json

# With a custom output directory
python src/vis_all_groups.py tests/sequential/3tasks.json --output-dir custom_output

# Toy model mode - visualize only two extreme constructions
python src/vis_all_groups.py tests/sequential/5tasks.json --toy-model --output-dir output/toy_model
```

### Toy Model Mode

The `--toy-model` flag enables a simplified analysis that focuses on two extreme workflow construction strategies:

1. **Grouped Strategy**: All tasks in a single group (minimum number of groups)
2. **Separated Strategy**: One group per task (maximum number of groups)

This mode is useful for:
- Quick comparison of extreme grouping strategies
- Understanding the trade-offs between grouping and separation
- Simplified analysis for educational or demonstration purposes
- Focused visualization of key metrics without overwhelming detail

The toy model generates the same comprehensive visualizations but only for these two extreme cases, making it easier to understand the fundamental differences between grouped and separated approaches.

The script will:
1. Automatically detect the template directory name (e.g., "sequential" or "fork") from the input file path
2. Create the appropriate output directory structure (e.g., `output/sequential/3tasks/` or `custom_output/sequential/3tasks/`)
3. Save all visualizations and data files in that directory
4. Generate an interactive HTML file with Mermaid diagrams for workflow topology visualization

You can get help on the command line arguments by running:
```bash
python src/vis_all_groups.py --help
```

The tool saves both the visualizations and the raw metrics data in JSON format for further analysis.

### Analysis Benefits

The visualizations help:
1. Identify optimal group sizes for different metrics
2. Understand tradeoffs between resource utilization and throughput
3. Analyze dependency patterns
4. Find correlations between different metrics
5. Make informed decisions about task grouping strategies
6. Compare different workflow construction approaches
7. Evaluate storage and network transfer requirements

### Integration with Visualization

The module works seamlessly with the visualization tool (`vis_all_groups.py`):
```python
from find_all_groups import create_workflow_from_json
from vis_all_groups import visualize_groups

# Generate groups and visualize
groups, tasks, construction_metrics, dag = create_workflow_from_json(workflow_data)
visualize_groups(groups, construction_metrics, template_path, output_dir="output", dag=dag)
```

This integration allows for:
- Visual analysis of different grouping strategies
- Comparison of resource utilization patterns
- Identification of optimal group sizes
- Understanding of tradeoffs between different metrics
- Analysis of workflow construction alternatives
- Evaluation of parallel execution potential
