## Metrics Tracked

The visualization tool tracks and analyzes comprehensive metrics for both individual groups and workflow constructions:

### Group-Level Metrics

#### CPU Metrics
- **`max_cores`**: Maximum CPU cores allocated to the group
- **`cpu_seconds`**: Total CPU time required (cores Ã— wallclock time)
- **`utilization_ratio`**: Actual CPU usage / allocated CPU (efficiency metric)

#### Memory Metrics
- **`max_mb`/`min_mb`**: Maximum/minimum memory requirements across tasks (in megabytes)
- **`occupancy`**: Time-weighted average memory usage / max memory allocated

#### Throughput Metrics
- **`total_eps`**: Group-level events per second (total events / total CPU time)
- **`max_eps`**: Highest events/second achieved by any single task in the group
- **`min_eps`**: Lowest events/second achieved by any single task in the group
- **Note**: For single-task groups, all three throughput values are identical

#### I/O Metrics
- **`input_data_mb`**: Total input data volume for the group
- **`output_data_mb`**: Total output data volume from all tasks
- **`stored_data_mb`**: Data volume that needs persistent storage
- **`*_per_event_mb`**: Per-event data volumes for each category

#### Resource Utilization Metrics
- **`resource_utilization`**: Overall efficiency (average of CPU and memory utilization)
- **`event_throughput`**: Events processed per second at group level

#### Group Configuration
- **`events_per_job`**: Number of events each task processes (based on target wallclock time)
- **`entry_point_task`**: First task to execute in the group
- **`exit_point_task`**: Last task to execute in the group
- **`dependency_paths`**: All dependency relationships between tasks in the group

### Workflow Construction Metrics

For each workflow construction, the following metrics are calculated and analyzed:

#### 1. Group Composition Metrics
- Number of groups in the construction
- Tasks per group distribution
- Group size statistics (min, max, average)

#### 2. Performance Metrics
- Event throughput (events processed per second)
- Total CPU time across all groups
- Parallel execution efficiency (ratio of sequential to parallel execution time)
- Critical path length (longest path in terms of CPU time)

#### 3. Data Flow Metrics
- Total input data volume (MB)
- Total output data volume (MB)
- Total stored data volume (MB)
- Stored data per event ratio
- Network transfer volume (sum of input and output data)

#### 4. Resource Utilization Metrics
- CPU utilization ratio per group (actual CPU usage / allocated CPU)
- Memory occupancy per group (actual memory usage / allocated memory)
- Average resource utilization across groups
- Standard deviation of resource utilization

#### 5. Event Processing Metrics
- Events per group distribution
- Total events processed
- Events per task statistics
- Event processing efficiency

#### 6. Storage Efficiency Metrics
- Storage efficiency (stored data per event)
- Storage utilization ratio
- Data retention patterns

#### 7. Network Transfer Metrics
- Total data transferred between groups
- Input/output data ratios

These metrics help in:

2. Identifying bottlenecks in resource utilization
3. Understanding data flow patterns
4. Optimizing group compositions
5. Balancing performance and resource usage
6. Making informed decisions about workflow optimization

## Usage

### Python API

```python
from vis_all_groups import visualize_groups

# After getting groups from create_workflow_from_json
visualize_groups(groups, construction_metrics, template_path, output_dir="output", dag=dag)
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Basic usage with default output directory
python src/vis_all_groups.py tests/sequential/3tasks.json

# With a custom output directory
python src/vis_all_groups.py tests/sequential/3tasks.json --output-dir custom_output

# Toy model mode - visualize only two extreme constructions
python src/vis_all_groups.py tests/sequential/5tasks.json --toy-model --output-dir output/toy_model
```

### Toy Model Mode

The `--toy-model` flag enables a simplified analysis that focuses on two extreme workflow construction strategies:

1. **Grouped Strategy**: All tasks in a single group (minimum number of groups)
2. **Separated Strategy**: One group per task (maximum number of groups)

This mode is useful for:
- Quick comparison of extreme grouping strategies
- Understanding the trade-offs between grouping and separation
- Simplified analysis for educational or demonstration purposes
- Focused visualization of key metrics without overwhelming detail

The toy model generates the same comprehensive visualizations but only for these two extreme cases, making it easier to understand the fundamental differences between grouped and separated approaches.

### Output Structure

The script will:
1. Automatically detect the template directory name (e.g., "sequential" or "fork") from the input file path
2. Create the appropriate output directory structure (e.g., `output/sequential/3tasks/` or `custom_output/sequential/3tasks/`)
3. Save all visualizations and data files in that directory
4. Generate an interactive HTML file with Mermaid diagrams for workflow topology visualization

### Help and Options

You can get help on the command line arguments by running:
```bash
python src/vis_all_groups.py --help
```

The tool saves both the visualizations and the raw metrics data in JSON format for further analysis.

## Analysis Benefits

The visualizations help:
1. Identify optimal group sizes for different metrics
2. Understand tradeoffs between resource utilization and throughput
3. Analyze dependency patterns
4. Find correlations between different metrics
5. Make informed decisions about task grouping strategies
6. Compare different workflow construction approaches
7. Evaluate storage and network transfer requirements

## Integration with Core Analysis

The module works seamlessly with the core analysis tool (`find_all_groups.py`):
```python
from find_all_groups import create_workflow_from_json
from vis_all_groups import visualize_groups

# Generate groups and visualize
groups, tasks, construction_metrics, dag = create_workflow_from_json(workflow_data)
visualize_groups(groups, construction_metrics, template_path, output_dir="output", dag=dag)
```

This integration allows for:
- Visual analysis of different grouping strategies
- Comparison of resource utilization patterns
- Identification of optimal group sizes
- Understanding of tradeoffs between different metrics
- Analysis of workflow construction alternatives
- Evaluation of parallel execution potential
